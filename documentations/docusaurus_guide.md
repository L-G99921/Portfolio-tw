## Overview
Docusaurus is an open-source tool developed by Facebook to simplify the creation of static sites and technical documentation. It is based on React and offers a simple and intuitive setup.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14.0 or higher)
- **npm** (Node.js package manager)

> ℹ️ **Note:** You can verify the installation of Node.js and npm by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal.

## Installation
1. **Install the Docusaurus CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @docusaurus/init
   ```

2. **Create a new Docusaurus project:**
   ```bash
   npx @docusaurus/init@latest init your-project-name classic
   ```
   Replace `your-project-name` with the desired name for your project.

## Project Configuration
1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your Docusaurus site in action.

## Project Structure
The basic structure of a Docusaurus project includes the following directories and files:

- **`docs/`**: Where you place your Markdown documentation files.
- **`blog/`**: Directory for blog posts (optional).
- **`src/`**: Custom source files, such as React components.
- **`docusaurus.config.js`**: Main configuration file for Docusaurus.
- **`sidebars.js`**: Sidebar configuration for your documentation.

## Main Commands
- **Start the development server:**
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Build the site for production:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Serve the built site:**
  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```

> ℹ️ **Tip:** Use `npm run build` and `npm run serve` to test your site before deploying.

## Customization
Docusaurus allows extensive customization through configuration files and CSS styles. Common customizations include:

- **Modify the navigation bar:** Edit the `docusaurus.config.js` file.
- **Change the theme:** Add or modify CSS files in `src/css/custom.css`.
- **Add plugins:** Install and configure plugins through `docusaurus.config.js`.

## Common Troubleshooting
- **Error `npm: command not found`:** Ensure Node.js and npm are installed and configured in the system PATH.
- **Error `docusaurus: command not found`:** Check if Docusaurus is correctly installed.
