## Overview

Docusaurus is an open-source tool developed by Meta (Facebook) that simplifies the creation of static sites and technical documentation. It's based on React and offers a straightforward, intuitive setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have these prerequisites installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14.0 or higher)
- **npm** (Node.js package manager)

**Note**: You can verify the installation of Node.js and npm by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the terminal.

## Installation

1. **Install the Docusaurus CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @docusaurus/init
   ```

2. **Create a new Docusaurus project**:
   ```bash
   npx @docusaurus/init@latest init your-project-name classic
   ```
   Replace `your-project-name` with the name you want for your project.

## Project configuration

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your Docusaurus site in action.

## Project structure

The basic structure of a Docusaurus project includes these directories and files:

- **`docs/`**: Where you place your Markdown documentation files
- **`blog/`**: Directory for blog posts (optional)
- **`src/`**: Custom source files, such as React components
- **`docusaurus.config.js`**: Main configuration file for Docusaurus
- **`sidebars.js`**: Sidebar configuration for your documentation

## Main commands

- **Start the development server**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- **Build the site for production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Serve the built site**:
  ```bash
  npm run serve
  ```

**Tip**: Use `npm run build` and `npm run serve` to test your site before you deploy it.

## Customization

Docusaurus allows extensive customization through configuration files and CSS styles. Common customizations include:

- **Modify the navigation bar**: Edit the `docusaurus.config.js` file
- **Change the theme**: Add or modify CSS files in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Add plugins**: Install and configure plugins through `docusaurus.config.js`

## Troubleshooting

- **Error `npm: command not found`**: Make sure Node.js and npm are installed and configured in the system PATH
- **Error `docusaurus: command not found`**: Check if Docusaurus is correctly installed

**Note**: For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).
