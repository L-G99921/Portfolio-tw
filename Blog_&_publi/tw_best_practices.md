- **Table of Contents:** Include a TOC for longer documents to provide an overview and facilitate navigation.
- **Sections:** Break content into manageable sections and subsections.

### Visual Aids
- **Screenshots and Diagrams:** Use visual aids to illustrate complex concepts or procedures. Ensure they are clear, labeled, and relevant.
- **Code Snippets:** For technical documentation, include code examples to clarify usage and implementation.

### Formatting and Style
- **Bullet Points:** Use bullet points for lists to improve readability.
- **Bold and Italics:** Use these sparingly to emphasize key points or terms.
- **Consistent Style Guide:** Adhere to a style guide to maintain consistency in tone, language, and formatting.

### Review and Edit
- **Proofreading:** Always proofread your documentation to eliminate typos and grammatical errors.
- **Peer Review:** Have colleagues review your work for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
- **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from actual users to identify areas for improvement.

### Continuous Improvement
- **Updates:** Regularly update documentation to reflect changes in the product or technology.
- **Metrics:** Track usage metrics and support tickets to identify common issues and update documentation accordingly.
